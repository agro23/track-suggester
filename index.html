    <h1>Epicodus Program Preference Survey</h1>

      <div class="panel-heading"><h3>Determine which learning track is right for you!</h3></div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <div>
          <p>There are multiple tracks of study you can take at Epicodus.
            Each one focuses on a particular <a href="GOOGLE.COM" alt="LINK TO COMPUTER LANGUAGE DEFINITION">language</a> and development platform
            (after you have learned the basics of programming in HTML, CSS, and javascript of course!)
          </p>
          <p>REWRITE?
            Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity
            inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written
            in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one
            company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and
            Java for their back-end processing.
          </p>
          <p>The following unscientific survey should help you determine which track will best match your interests to make your learning path more enjoyable.</p>

      <strong>C#</strong>
      C# (spoken as 'C sharp') is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software.
      Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the
      most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately,
      with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux,
      and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a
      larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.

      <strong>JAVA</strong>
      Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most
      popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing
      to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used
      in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an
      enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications,
      Java could be a good language to learn.

      PHP is by far the most popular backend language today, with 80 percent of websites utilizing it 'server-side'.
      It is perhaps best known for it's use in content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla. But
      the versatility of the language and the frameworks it powers make employment options numerous and diverse.
      If you're keen to work for a fast paced agency that builds websites for lots of clients, or maintain the
      security and stability of a huge complex of government websites, or if you like the idea of building out small
      sites for brands, businesses, and organizations - In any of these cases, PHP would be a great way to go.

      <strong>RUBY</strong>
      Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating
      accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby.
      Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks
      associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking
      to build their product quickly.

    <strong>CSS</strong>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors,
      layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices,
      such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS —
      used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.
      CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the
      layout, colors, and fonts. You will find any business with a front-facing website will need to employ someone
      ßcapable of programming CSS to make their webpages usable.
