          <p>There are multiple tracks of study you can take at Epicodus.
            Each one focuses on a particular language and development platform
            (after you have learned the basics of programming in HTML, CSS, and javascript of course!)
          </p>
          <p>The following survey should help you determine which track will best match your interests to make your learning path more enjoyable.</p>
          <p>While the results are not scientific, the answer should help point you in the right direction.</p>
